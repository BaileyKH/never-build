# Never Build
The web app that will never build your project idea (Productive, right?) All jokes aside, Never Build was just a fun project idea to goof around and let the creative juices flow. It takes in user input, gives the impression that it is hard at work building the users app idea utilizing a loading bar and some silly messages, then bails out at the end.
